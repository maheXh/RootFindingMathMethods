This toolkit is a vital addition to your computational toolbox, offering reliable solutions for a wide range of equations.

## Bisection Method

The Bisection Method is a robust and intuitive root-finding algorithm that excels in isolating roots within an interval. Its simplicity and convergence properties make it a valuable tool for locating real roots of equations. By iteratively narrowing down the interval containing the root, the Bisection Method ensures convergence to high precision.

To use the Bisection Method, follow these steps:

1. Define your target equation and choose an interval [a, b] where the root is suspected to exist.

2. Implement the Bisection Method, which involves repeatedly halving the interval and selecting the subinterval where the function changes sign.

3. Continue this process until the interval becomes sufficiently small or until the desired level of precision is achieved.
